# Bellybutton_Biodiversity

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create charts using plotly with JavaScript and use HTML to create a custom dashboard to display sample results dynamically with the click of each option on the dropdown menu. The data can then be used by a research team hoping to gather information about the top bacterial cultures found in the belly button that could be used to create synthetic meat in the laboratory. 

## Results
### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
The horizontal bar chart was created by taking the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the sample, reversing them to create a top-down horizontal bar chart, and displaying them on the dashboard. Each time a test subject id number is chosen from the dropdown menu, a new bar chart is created dynamically to display that subject's bacteria cultures.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
The bubble chart was created with the bacteria IDs and values, to show the total bacterial cultures found per sample; bacteria with higher values are displayed with larger bubbles to visualize their size. Each time a test subject id number is chosen from the dropdown menu, a new bubble chart is created dynamically to display that subject's bacteria cultures.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
The gauge chart displays the test subject's washing frequency on a range from 0-10 scrubs per week. When the test subject id number is chosen from the dropdown menu, the gauge chart is created with an indicator pointing to that subject's washing frequency. Steps were created along the guage chart with different colors to display the washing frequencies clearly.

### Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
To customize the dashboard, I wanted to add more color, create a paragraph to explain the project to site visitors, and add an image to the jumbotron background. I changed the jumbotron background to a picture taken of a bacterial culture from the umbilicus taken by Steve Gschmeissner using scanning electron microscopy. The image was retrieved from science photo library here: https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/869745/view/bacterial-culture-from-the-umbilicus-sem (watermarks included in the jumbotron image).

Next, I wanted to match some of the pink tones in the image header, so I chaned the color of the block behind the dropdown menu and of the body text, where I also inserted a paragraph about the project. Finally, I changed the jumbotron text to white so it would pop against the dark background.

## Summary
The final dashboard includes the three charts created with the belly button bacterial sample data customized with bootstrap components. The final page was also deployed to github pages.
